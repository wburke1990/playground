# Playground Repo

For practicing.

So... I am in the habit of always rebasing my code before I start working. I actually pulled the changes to this README and merged them on Sept. 13, before even looking at the HW. Rather than revert a bunch of commits and doing everything again, I'm just going to commit this message, then pull the original and make another commit on top of it.
